Hello, I am a Software Engineer from the United Kingdom. I'm based in the Northwest, near Manchester.

Most of my teenage years were spent riding my bikes, and watching cartoons, and playing about on the family computer, before I was given a computer of my own as a Christmas Present one year. After discovering computers simply do what you ask them to do, it wasn't long before I was making basic websites and attempted to teach myself some basic scripting. This naturally led to me completing a Computer Science degree at the Manchester Metropolitan  University with a first class honours degree. I still enjoy working on computers as a hobby, along with my MX-5, cooking and eating out.

The languages I currently use on a regular basis and enjoy working with the most are C# and Javascript. Recently I am enjoying making SPA using ReactJS, as well as creating ASP.NET Core applications and Docker.
