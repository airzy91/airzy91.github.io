Hello, I am a Software Engineer from the UK. I'm based in the Northwest, near Manchester.

Most of my teenage years were spent riding bikes, watching cartoons, and playing about on computers. My love computers went on leading me to University where I completed a Computer Science degree at the Manchester Metropolitan University with a first class honours degree. I still enjoy working on computers as a hobby, along with my MX-5, cooking and eating out.

The languages I currently use on a regular basis and enjoy working with the most are C# and Javascript. Recently I am enjoying making SPA using ReactJS, as well as creating ASP.NET Core applications and Docker. I'd also like to get to grips with some functional programming.
