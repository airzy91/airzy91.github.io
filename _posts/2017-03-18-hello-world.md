# Hello World!

Hello, and welcome to my blog! Hopefully you've stumbled here and found something interesting. If you'd like to know more about me, you can read a bit of background about myself [here](/about).

## The Blog

I'll be using the blog to write up intresting posts, and most likely a place to document things I learn along the road as a developer. I don't expect everything I write to be perfect, and I'll do my best to be as helpful as possible!

Initially I'd like to write up a small series about ReactJS and Redux, as I'm currently learning myself, and writing up my process feels like a nice way to document what I'm doing/have done. If that means I can help someone else along the road than even better!

Theres a possibility I'll write up some personal posts now and then, but more than likely a few posts about cars and my MX-5. But it should mostly be development focused!

Thanks for reading!

Aaron
